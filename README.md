# Predictive-Maintenance-Analysis
 Analyzed 10,000 maintenance logs and sensor data points to identify patterns in machine failures .  Utilized Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) to clean data and engineer key predictive features like Power Consumption and Temperature Difference.  Trained a Random Forest model that accurately predicts machine failures, achieving over 99% accuracy.
