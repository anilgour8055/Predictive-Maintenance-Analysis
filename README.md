## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sensor data from industrial equipment to predict machine failures. The goal is to build a reliable classification model that can identify machines at risk, helping to reduce costs associated with unplanned downtime.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the "AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Tools and Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for Random Forest model)

Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

Engineered features like Power and Temperature Difference were strong predictors of failure.

The final Random Forest model achieved over 99% accuracy and a recall of 87% for failure events, meaning it successfully caught most actual failures.
